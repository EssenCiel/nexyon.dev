4. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (accuracy);
5. kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as they are processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89(1), subject to the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures required by the Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (storage limitation);
6. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures (integrity and confidentiality).

Processing shall be lawful only if, and to the extent that, at least one of the following applies:

1. the data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;
2. processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;

4. processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
5. processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
6. processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

For residents of the State of California, this privacy policy is intended to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

### How We Protect Your Personal Data

The security of your data is our top priority. To ensure the protection and integrity of your personal information, we have implemented robust security measures.

We also conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to quickly identify and rectify any potential vulnerabilities. All stored data is encrypted, and we follow strict access control policies to prevent unauthorized access.

While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our user data is secure and users are protected, there is always a risk of harm. The internet as a whole can sometimes be insecure, and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.
