2. collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes shall not be considered incompatible with the initial purposes (purpose limitation);

4. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (accuracy);
5. kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as they are processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89(1), subject to the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures required by the Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (storage limitation);
6. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures (integrity and confidentiality).

Processing shall be lawful only if, and to the extent that, at least one of the following applies:

1. the data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;
2. processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;

4. processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
5. processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;

For residents of the State of California, this privacy policy is intended to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

### How Long We Store Personal Data

User data will be retained for a duration of: 1 year

We will ensure that users are notified if their data is kept longer than this duration.

### How We Protect Your Personal Data

As part of our unwavering commitment to protect the privacy and integrity of our users' data, we have implemented stringent data anonymization and security strategies. Data anonymization is a critical process by which we remove or modify any information that could personally identify a user. This approach ensures that the data collected cannot be associated with any specific individual, thereby enhancing the privacy protection of our users. Additionally, we employ the Transport Layer Security (TLS) security protocol for encrypting data during transit over the internet. TLS is a globally recognized standard for securing online information exchanges, ensuring that all data transmitted between users and our service remains encrypted and safe from malicious interceptions. This combination of data anonymization and TLS encryption forms a robust shield against the risks of data breaches and information leaks, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to maintaining the security and confidentiality of our users' data at every stage of its processing.

While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our user data is secure and users are protected, there is always a risk of harm. The internet as a whole can sometimes be insecure, and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.

### Minors

The GDPR specifies that individuals under the age of 15 are considered minors for data collection purposes. Minors must have the consent of a legal guardian for their data to be collected, processed, and used.

### Your Rights as a User

Under the GDPR, users have the following rights as data subjects:

1. Right of access
2. Right to rectification
3. Right to erasure
4. Right to restriction of processing
5. Right to data portability
6. Right to object

Further information on these rights can be found in Chapter 3 (Articles 12-23) of the GDPR.
